                        In my role as a graphic designer and artist, I showcase a high level of proficiency in Adobe Photoshop, where I excel at creating visually impactful posters, digital art, and product mockups. My design philosophy is rooted in a deep understanding of fundamental principles, allowing me to imbue each project with a distinctive and compelling aesthetic. Additionally, I bring vector precision to my work using Adobe Illustrator, seamlessly integrating detailed assets into Photoshop projects for enhanced scalability and intricacy.

                        <br>
                        Building on my experience as a newsletter layout artist, I demonstrate adept use of Adobe InDesign, leveraging the software to design and publish engaging newspaper layouts. This involves a keen focus on readability, aesthetics, and effective communication of content. Finally, my proficiency in Adobe Animate adds a dynamic dimension to my skill set, allowing me to merge my art skills with animation and create projects that captivate audiences.

                        My programming skills encompass various domains. Specifically, I excel in creating Graphical User Interfaces (GUI) using Java, leveraging the Swing library to develop intuitive and user-friendly applications. Additionally, I possess hands-on experience in Python, where I've successfully executed simple projects and demonstrated proficiency in utilizing the Flask web framework. When crafting websites, I often employ vanilla JavaScript to enhance interactivity, combining it seamlessly with HTML and CSS to create visually appealing and responsive web designs. This diverse skill set reflects my adaptability and proficiency across different programming languages and frameworks.
